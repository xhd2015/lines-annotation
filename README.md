# Lines Annotation
This library abstracts a general representation of code, which braces line coverage, block annotation and diff info.

Then, built on top of this representation, coverage info from different commits are able be merged together, which facilitates coverage inheritance.

# Usage
This project is used by [xgo](https://github.com/xhd2015/xgo) as core library to provide coverage report.
